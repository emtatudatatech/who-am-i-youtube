## Back Story
2 years ago, I worked on an analysis project entitled: [Who Am I? | Spotify](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-am-i-spotify-part-1-michael-maina/)

You can read all about it in the link above, but basically, I extracted my Spotify streaming data using Spotify APIs and then analyzed it to create a Power BI report displaying insights about my listening habits for the past year up to that point.

The goal was always to do one for YouTube as well, but I was not intentional about it last year.

So, it is now 2024, and here I am. Finally ready to complete the YouTube rendition of **Who Am I**?

I am excited to learn what my YouTube data reveals about me. And with more tools and skills with me, this should be a fun Analytics Engineering and Data Storytelling project.

Welcome to **Who Am I? | YouTube**
